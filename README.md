# Layers

Layers is a browser-based media editor with non-destructive layer compositing, powered by the Noisemaker shader pipeline. It runs entirely client-side.

## Features

- Layer stack with opacity, blend modes, visibility, and locking
- GPU-accelerated effects via WebGL shaders (blur, warp, noise, edge detection, dither, and others)
- Selection tools: rectangle, oval, lasso, polygon, magic wand
- Selection operations: expand, contract, feather, smooth, border, color range
- Image and video layer support
- Copy/paste, crop to selection, canvas resize, image resize
- Project persistence via IndexedDB
- Undo/redo with debounced parameter tracking

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm
- A browser with WebGL2 support

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts a local server on port 3002.

### Noisemaker

The shader pipeline is loaded at runtime from the [Noisemaker](https://github.com/noisedeck/noisemaker) CDN at `shaders.noisedeck.app`.

## Testing

End-to-end tests use Playwright:

```
npm test
```
