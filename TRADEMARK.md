# Layers Trademark Policy

**Effective Date:** February 6, 2026

## 1. Purpose

This Trademark Policy ("Policy") governs the use of certain names and branding in connection with derivative works and products based on the Layers software project. This Policy is supplemental to the MIT License under which the source code is distributed.

## 2. Scope and Limitations

**We do not claim trademark rights to the word "Layers."** The term is generic and widely used. This Policy applies narrowly to prevent consumer confusion in contexts directly connected to this software project.

**"Noise Factor"** is a distinctive mark associated with this project and its related tooling. We ask that this term not be used in the names of derivative products.

## 3. Permitted Uses

You **may** use "Layers" and "Noise Factor" without prior permission in the following circumstances:

- **Attribution:** Referring to the Layers project by name in documentation, articles, tutorials, or other descriptive contexts (e.g., "This project uses Layers" or "Built with Layers").
- **Unmodified Distribution:** Distributing unmodified copies of the software, provided you comply with the MIT License.
- **Academic and Research Use:** Referencing the project in academic papers, presentations, or research materials.
- **Community Discussion:** Discussing the project in forums, social media, or community channels.
- **Unrelated Products:** Using "layers" in product names for software unrelated to layer-based media editing or shader-driven image composition.

## 4. Restricted Uses

When creating derivative works or products **based on or incorporating this software**, you **may not**:

- **Use "Noise Factor"** as the name, or part of the name, of your product, service, or derivative work.
- **Imply Official Status:** Use "Layers" in a manner that suggests your derivative is the official Layers project, or is endorsed by or affiliated with the Layers maintainers.
- **Create Confusion:** Use names, logos, or branding designed to create confusion between your derivative and this project.

## 5. Derivative Works

If you create a derivative work based on this software:

- You may not use "Noise Factor" in your product name.
- You must include a notice that your project is not the official Layers software and is not endorsed by the project maintainers.

## 6. Requesting Permission

To request permission for uses not covered by this Policy, or to ask questions, please open an issue in the project repository or contact the maintainers directly.

## 7. Relationship to the MIT License

The source code is licensed under the MIT License. This Trademark Policy operates as a supplemental set of guidelines to prevent confusion in the ecosystem. It does not restrict your rights under the MIT License to use, modify, and distribute the code.
